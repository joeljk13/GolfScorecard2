Notes for improvements and changes to do for GolfScorecard2:

1.  Don't delete a locally-stored scorecard if it hasn't been saved (or might not have been saved)
    on the server.

2.  When a scorecard is saved to the server, save the timestamp when it can be deleted. Say, 30 days
    in the future.

3.  When saving a scorecard, check for local scorecards that can be deleted, and delete them.

4.  Before saying a scorecard locally, delete the expiration timestamp first so you don't have a
    situation when data hasn't been saved to the server but there is a timestamp for when it can be
    deleted.

5.  Use a unique local filename for each active scorecard.

6.  When you load the list of courses for a given userspace, save that list locally so it is cached
    if the phone looses connectivity with the server.

7.  Look at WebPack at webpack.js.org/comparison to see if it can be used to combine and minimize
    groups of files.  It could replace my batch file or part of it.

8.  Refactor the directory structure so that the output files are generated in a top-level .\dist
    directory.  This is what jQuery uses.  This means, for example:
        .\src\js_dev\   ==>     .\src\js\
        .\src\js\       ==>     .\dist\js\
    This means that the generated files are moved outside of .\src and into .\dist.  That way, .\src
    only has source files and not gnerated output files.

9.  Update all third party libraries that have updates.  Update NodeJS and its libraries, too.

10. Look at GruntJS (gruntjs.com) for replacing Windows batch files with something more popular.

11. Transform the Windows batch file to build everything into a make file.  There is an existing make
    file in the source tree, so simply update it.

12. Bug: The attributes in the Total column are not sorted alphabetically.  So 3^{bm} can appear attributes
    3*{mb} in the Total column.
